I recently wrote my own implementation of the problematic pytailf, so I removed the import and integrated it directly into the
sshmonitor.py script. This made the patch obsolete, so I removed the patch dir from the project.

I added a one second sleep to the end of the tail file method so that it doesnt cause a spike in the load.

Added the ability to specify your own regex on the command line as an arg that is passed to the program. 
If none are passed then the defaults are used.

Removed the need for the build.sh script. All of the necessary building of shared objects and executables is done through the build.c program now.
